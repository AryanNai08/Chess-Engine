@@ Method:isValidMovement

this method ensure that knight move in correct order

the logic is like that if the value of targeted col - current col * targeted row - current row is equal to 2 than its a vaild move

Example:
	Example:

	Initial Position: (4, 4)
	Target Position 1: (6, 5) (two steps right, one step up)
	Calculation:
	Math.abs(6 - 4) * Math.abs(5 - 4) = 2 * 1 = 2
	Valid move.
	Target Position 2: (5, 6) (one step right, two steps up)
	Calculation:
	Math.abs(5 - 4) * Math.abs(6 - 4) = 1 * 2 = 2
	Valid move.
	Invalid Example:
	Target Position: (5, 5) (one step diagonally)
	Calculation:
	Math.abs(5 - 4) * Math.abs(5 - 4) = 1 * 1 = 1
	Invalid move.
